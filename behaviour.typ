Mechanisms of learning are different amongst all animals.

Generally all animals can learn something (where animal is taken as a broad catgory).

Molecular models of learning are just *models* and not proven laws.

Some definitions of learning

- Conditioned learning  is an approach where learning takes place through negative or positive reinforcement (generally just negative). This is a simple form of learning.
- *Unconditioned stimulus* - the stimulus under no learning or experience
- *Conditioned experience* - the training conditions
- *Conditioned response* - what is the desired behaviour or taught response
- *Habituation* - retraiing to lose a conditioed response if repeated with some experienced result
- *Associative learning* - connection between cause and effect.
- Opelant (instrumental) - the animal makes a decision which has consequences

There is an unresolved debate between the relative importance between conditioning and cognitiion.

- *Transitive Inference* using known relationships to deduce new relationships (e.g., A > B, B > C => A > C)

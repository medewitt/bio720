# Questions

## How do cells "sense" when they are infected with a virus? How do they "turn on" interferon gene expression?

Cells utilizes a series of approaches.
One of the approaches is the through pathogen-associated molecular patterns which recognize particular foreign protein patterns and then initiate autocrine and paracrine signalling responses.
These approaches include the existance of toll-like receptors (TLRs), RIG-1-like receptors, and nucleotide-binding organization triggers.
These then upregulate expression of chemochines, cytokines, and interferons.

## What was already known about regulation of the transcription factor NF-kB?

NF-kB is known to regulate innate immunity, adaptive immunity, cell differentiation, proliferation, and survival.
NF-kB is known to mediate inflatmoty responses and is typically sequestered in the cytoplasm.
When not activated it is inhibited by the IkB; however in response to stress the IkB is phorspohalated and triggers ubiquitin mediated degratation freeing the NF-kB to go to the nucleos to induce cytokine, chemokine, responses.

## What was already known about the cellular targets of rotavirus NSP1?

NSP1 is known to target b-TrCP, IRF3/5/7/9, MAVS, and/or TNF receptorassociated factor 2 (TRAF2) to try to regulate host immune response.
However, the C-terminius is highly variable and there was some though that the RING domain near the N terminus may act as an ubiquitin ligase.


## What was the overall objective of this study?

The objective of this study is to show that NSP1 can inhibit host interferon response through the blocking of the release of NF-kB.
Furthermore, this study shows that the mechanism is likely through the preservation of the bTrCp which disallows the turnover of the IkB disallowing the NF-kB to reach the nucleous to generate an innate immune response

# Definitions

**Autocrine** signaling is a form of signaling in which a cell secretes a hormone or a chemical substance that binds to the receptors on the same cell, leading to functional changes in the cell (Liang et al 10.4161/cbt.26717)

**Paracrine** signaling is a form of cell signaling in which the target cell is near the signal-releasing cell. (Liang et al 10.4161/cbt.26717)

## Panel A

![](2024-02-04-15-59-56.png)

### Q 

Where are the genetic differences in the differential immune antagonism observed in the NSP1 protein?

### M

Phylogentic analysis of the ORFs from NSP1 in genbank using an unrooted tree generated from maximum likelihood approaches.

### R

Genotype A has 4 major groups/clusters

### C

There are four clusters. I agree with this finding. NV recombination may make this tree a little challenging? I don't know.



## Panel B

![](2024-02-04-16-00-41.png)

### Q

Are these observed phylogenetic differences related to species alternate life -histories?

### M

Create a cladogram to examine the origins of the sequences (i.e., host species) given the phylogeny

### R

Yes, there are some noted differences by species.

### C

I agree with this finding but I worry about sampling bias.

Types appeared to separate into their phylogenetic history.

## Panel C

![](2024-02-04-16-00-56.png)

### Q

Are the sequences in the domains of interest conserved across species in details?

### M

Examine the consensus sequences among the two domains of interest for NSP1 by host-species.

### R

NSP1 sequences used in this study are indicated.
The sequences appear to be highly conserved across the species in the OSU group (porcine) and to some extent the human one.

### C

All full-length RVA NSP1 proteins are thought to utilize an N-terminal RING domain to interact with a cellular E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme and a C-terminal sequence element to provide binding specificity for a host innate immune target

## Panel D

### Q

Are the PDL sequences conserved within the human sequences?

### M

Review the sequences.

### R

Alignment of viral PDL motifs and phosphodegrons from known targets of $beta$-TrCP shown with high degree of conservation except maybe VAC.

### C

Yes, it appears that there is some alignment.

Arrowheads indicate the OSU-C13 and SA11-4F-C17 (SA11-5S) truncation mutants. The PDL motif is shaded in grey. (B) HEK293T cells were cotransfected with NSP1 and NF-B firefly and HSV-tk Renilla luciferase reporters. At 24 h p.t., cells were stimulated for 4 h with medium  25 ng/ml TNF-. Relative luciferase activity was calculated by normalizing firefly to Renilla luciferase activity. Data (mean  SD from one of three experiments performed in triplicate) were analyzed by two-way ANOVA (pairwise as indicated) using Tukey’s multiple comparisons test. (C) HEK293T cells cotransfected with NSP1 and FLAG--TrCP were assayed 24 h p.t. by quantitative immunoblotting (IB) (normalized to PCNA). The level of -TrCP is expressed as a percentage of -TrCP in OSU-C13-transfected cells. Data (mean  SD from three independent transfections) were analyzed pairwise with OSU. ns, not significant (P  0.05); **, P  0.01; ***, P  0.001. See also Fig. S1 to S4 in the supplemental material.

## Panel A

![](2024-02-04-16-02-29.png)

### Q

Can we make a mutant with a truncated PDL motif?

### M

MAke a truncation mutant

### R

A truncation mutant was made.

### C

This figure just shows that the delta C truncation mutant was made.



## Panel B

![](2024-02-04-16-02-41.png)

### Q

With the truncation of the C-termininus domain, will we see the immunoregulatory features?


### M

HEK cells were transfected with NSP1 anf NFkB with a luciferase reporter.
The NSP1 mutant was transfected.
Activated with TNF-alpha.
Thus if NfkB is expressed, we will see it with the luciferase reporter with higher level indicating that the expected antiviral response is taking place.

### R

OSU NSP1 blocked activation (wt) while truncation mutant did not in the presence of TNF alpha.
This mutant was also seen in both the OSU-C42A (point mutant predicted to disrupt the N-terminal RING domain) and SA11-4F (which mediates the degradation of IRFs but not -TrCP)


### C

## Panel C

![](2024-02-04-16-02-51.png)

### Q

What is the role of the PDL motif in NSP1 mediation of beta TrCP?

### M

HEK cells transfected with NSP1 and FLAG-beta Trcp assayed by quantitative immunoblotting.
The level of -TrCP is expressed as a percentage of -TrCP in OSU-C13-transfected cells.

### R

50% lower in cells with the wild type vs the mutants.

### C

This shows again that the intact C-terminus appears to be important.

>Diverse functions of viral PDL motif-containing proteins. The models depict how RV NSP1, EBV LMP1, HIV-1 Vpu, and VACV A49 disrupt -TrCP activity. These viral proteins use a PDL motif to (i) induce the turnover of -TrCP (degradation), (ii) block -TrCP from recognizing cellular phosphodegrons (interaction), or (iii) induce the turnover of cellular proteins by bridging -TrCP to these targets (adaptor).

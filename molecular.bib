  abstract = {Summary: The mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) regulate diverse cellular programs by relaying extracellular signals to intracellular responses. In mammals, there are more than a dozen MAPK enzymes that coordinately regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, motility, and survival. The best known are the conventional MAPKs, which include the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), c-Jun amino-terminal kinases 1 to 3 (JNK1 to -3), p38 ({$\alpha$}, {$\beta$}, {$\gamma$}, and {$\delta$}), and ERK5 families. There are additional, atypical MAPK enzymes, including ERK3/4, ERK7/8, and Nemo-like kinase (NLK), which have distinct regulation and functions. Together, the MAPKs regulate a large number of substrates, including members of a family of protein Ser/Thr kinases termed MAPK-activated protein kinases (MAPKAPKs). The MAPKAPKs are related enzymes that respond to extracellular stimulation through direct MAPK-dependent activation loop phosphorylation and kinase activation. There are five MAPKAPK subfamilies: the p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK), the mitogen- and stress-activated kinase (MSK), the MAPK-interacting kinase (MNK), the MAPK-activated protein kinase 2/3 (MK2/3), and MK5 (also known as p38-regulated/activated protein kinase [PRAK]). These enzymes have diverse biological functions, including regulation of nucleosome and gene expression, mRNA stability and translation, and cell proliferation and survival. Here we review the mechanisms of MAPKAPK activation by the different MAPKs and discuss their physiological roles based on established substrates and recent discoveries.},

  abstract = {P-bodies are cytoplasmic condensates that accumulate low-translation mRNAs for temporary storage before translation or degradation. P-bodies have been best characterized in yeast and mammalian tissue culture cells. We describe here related condensates in the germline of animal models. Germline P-bodies have been reported at all stages of germline development from primordial germ cells to gametes. The activity of the universal germ cell fate regulator, Nanos, is linked to the mRNA decay function of P-bodies, and spatially-regulated condensation of P-body like condensates in embryos is required to localize mRNA regulators to primordial germ cells. In most cases, however, it is not known whether P-bodies represent functional compartments or non-functional condensation by-products that arise when ribonucleoprotein complexes saturate the cytoplasm. We speculate that the ubiquity of P-body-like condensates in germ cells reflects the strong reliance of the germline on cytoplasmic, rather than nuclear, mechanisms of gene regulation.},

  abstract = {Intracellular mRNA transport and local translation play a key role in neuronal physiology. Translationally repressed mRNAs are transported as a part of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particles to distant dendritic sites, but the properties of different RNP particles and mechanisms of their repression and transport remain largely unknown. Here, we describe a new class of RNP-particles, the dendritic P-body-like structures (dlPbodies), which are present in the soma and dendrites of mammalian neurons and have both similarities and differences to P-bodies of non-neuronal cells. These structures stain positively for a number of P-body and microRNP components, a microRNA-repressed mRNA and some translational repressors. They appear more heterogeneous than P-bodies of HeLa cells, and they rarely contain the exonuclease Xrn1 but are positive for rRNA. These particles show motorized movements along dendrites and relocalize to distant sites in response to synaptic activation. Furthermore, Dcp1a is stably associated with dlP-bodies in unstimulated cells, but exchanges rapidly on neuronal activation, concomitantly with the loss of Ago2 from dlP-bodies. Thus, dlP-bodies may regulate local translation by storing repressed mRNPs in unstimulated cells, and releasing them on synaptic activation.},

  abstract = {Protein synthesis is crucial for the maintenance of long-term memory-related synaptic plasticity. The cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein 3 (CPEB3) regulates the translation of several mRNAs important for long-term synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. In previous studies, we found that the oligomerization and activity of CPEB3 are controlled by small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)ylation. In the basal state, CPEB3 is SUMOylated; it is soluble and acts as a repressor of translation. Following neuronal stimulation, CPEB3 is de-SUMOylated; it now forms oligomers that are converted into an active form that promotes the translation of target mRNAs. To better understand how CPEB3 regulates the translation of its mRNA targets, we have examined CPEB3 subcellular localization. We found that basal, repressive CPEB3 is localized to membraneless cytoplasmic processing bodies (P bodies), subcellular compartments that are enriched in translationally repressed mRNA. This basal state is affected by the SUMOylation state of CPEB3. After stimulation, CPEB3 is recruited into polysomes, thus promoting the translation of its target mRNAs. Interestingly, when we examined CPEB3 recombinant protein in vitro, we found that CPEB3 phase separates when SUMOylated and binds to a specific mRNA target. These findings suggest a model whereby SUMO regulates the distribution, oligomerization, and activity of oligomeric CPEB3, a critical player in the persistence of memory.},

  abstract = {The cAMP responsive element binding protein (CREB) is a nuclear protein that modulates the transcription of genes with cAMP responsive elements in their promoters. Increases in the concentration of either calcium or cAMP can trigger the phosphorylation and activation of CREB. This transcription factor is a component of intracellular signaling events that regulate a wide range of biological functions, from spermatogenesis to circadian rhythms and memory. Here we review the key features of CREB-dependent transcription, as well as the involvement of CREB in memory formation. Evidence from Aplysia, Drosophila, mice, and rats shows that CREB-dependent transcription is required for the cellular events underlying long-term but not short-term memory. While the work in Aplysia and Drosophila only involved CREB function in very simple forms of conditioning, genetic and pharmacological studies in mice and rats demonstrate that CREB is required for a variety of complex forms of memory, including spatial and social learning, thus indicating that CREB may be a universal modulator of processes required for memory formation.},
